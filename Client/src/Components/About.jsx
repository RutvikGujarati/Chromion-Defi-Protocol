            <strong>NovaDapp </strong> is a decentralized cross-chain bridge and
            lending-borrowing designed to transfer tokens between the{" "}

            <strong>Ethereum Sepolia testnet</strong>, utilizing{" "}
            <strong>
              Chainlink CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol)

          <ul className="list-unstyled ms-3">
            <li>‚Ä¢ Users deposit native AVAX on Fuji.</li>
            <li>
              ‚Ä¢ An equal amount of <strong>bAVAX</strong> (bridged AVAX) is
              minted on Sepolia.
            </li>
            <li>
              ‚Ä¢ When bAVAX is burned on Sepolia, the original AVAX is refunded
              back on Fuji.

            <li>
              ‚Ä¢ LINK tokens are required for CCIP fee payments on both chains.
            </li>
            <li>
              ‚Ä¢ AVAX must be sent with the exact value as specified to avoid
              rejection.
            </li>
            <li>
              ‚Ä¢ Ensure correct wallet connections on both Fuji and Sepolia
              testnets.

            Note: This bridge is currently deployed on testnets for development

            NovaDapp also features a basic cross-chain lending protocol that
            allows users to supply and borrow tokens across Fuji and Sepolia
            testnets.

            <li>
              ‚Ä¢ Based on supplied collateral, users can borrow{" "}

            </li>
            <li>
              ‚Ä¢ Borrowing is capped at <strong>70%</strong> of the total supply
              amount (LTV ratio).

            <li>
              ‚Ä¢ Currently, there's no interest logic ‚Äî lending and borrowing
              follow a 1:1 static model.

            <li>
              ‚Ä¢ All messages for borrowing and repayment are handled via

            <li>
              ‚Ä¢ Real-time price feeds were considered but omitted due to testnet
              oracle availability issues.
            </li>
            <li>
              ‚Ä¢ Interest rate logic was initially added but removed for
              consistency and simplicity.
            </li>
            <li>
              ‚Ä¢ Deposits and borrowings are only simulated for testing, no real
              assets involved.

            This lending/borrowing module is ideal for testing cross-chain logic
